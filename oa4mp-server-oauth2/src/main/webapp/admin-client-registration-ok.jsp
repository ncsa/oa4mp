<h2>Administrative Client Registration Successful!</h2>
<p>Here is your client identifier:
<br><br><b>${client.identifier}</b>
</p>

<p>Here is your client secret:
<br><br><b>${client.secret}</b>
</p>

<br><br>IMPORTANT NOTE: It is the client's responsibility to store the identifier and secret.
Your client will need to use it
as needed to identify itself. Please keep these in a safe location. If you lose the secret, you will have to
re-regisiter. Be sure you copy the secret without line breaks (which some browsers will insert) or you will
get an invalid secret.
<p>
    An administrator will contact you once your registration request is approved. You cannot use this
    identifier code until you have been approved by the administrator.
