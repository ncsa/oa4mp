# A basic command file to show the format

echo
  Hello
  World;

# Note that the echo command spans several lines. Once a semi-colon is hit, that is the end of the command
# and it is processed.

# You can turn output on or off too

set_output_on false;

echo foo!;

# This last command executes, but there is no ouput.
