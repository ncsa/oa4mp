This tells how to work with scripts. A script is simply a sequence of commands that could
be entered manually. The format of the commands is very simple.

** Every line that starts with a hash (#) is a comment and is ignored
** Every command may span multiple lines and is terminated with a semicolon (;)

There are a few simple examples.

ex_hello_world.cmd = a basic hello world example
ex_create_keys.cmd = A file that will create a set of keys and print them to the console
ex_print_token.cmd = This has a signed JWT and will print it to the console.
