    <![CDATA[Property: String (--)
Used in the discovery endpoint for constructing and resolving the
well-known page. This is *not* a complete path, but is of the form

host/vo

So for instance, if your site is at

https://login.bgsu.edu/oauth2

and you have a discover_path of

login.bgsu.edu/my_issuer

then the resulting constructed well-known page would reside at

https://login.bgsu.edu/oauth2/.well-known/openid-configuration.my_issuer

and various entries in it would have their paths constructed from this as well, such
as the jwks_uri (which is where all the custom signing keys for this VO might
reside at

https://login.bgsu.org:8443/oauth2/certs/my_issuer

in some cases depending upon other configuration in the server, this may vary a bit with
the addition of port numbers.]]>

    <![CDATA[Virtual Organization.
OA4MP supports multiple issuers through its "virtual organization" mechanism.
A VO (virtual organization) has its own issuer, discovery endpoint and signing keys.

How's it work?
--------------
A VO exists outside of all clients. Admin clients may be added to the VO in which case all
of the VO environment (keys, issuers, etc.) is automatically inherited by any client.
It is possible to locally override this either in the client's cfg property or in a script.

How to make one?
----------------
Choose an id (that is a url) and use that. This identifier is only ever used internally,
so something like

production:/vo/caltech/igwn

is just fine. Then use this with the create command and select Y to edit the client. The
reason is that the logic flow for the client is followed. Read the prompts and do what
they say and you should have a fully functional VO at the end. You can test this by going to
your new well-known endpoint, which should be live at this point.

Uses
----
Any admin client is added to the VO by setting its vo_uri (and vo) property to be
the same as the vo_uri property here. Again, this is live and should be available for
testing immediately.
