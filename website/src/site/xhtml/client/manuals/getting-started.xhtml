    <title>OA4MP Client: Getting Started</title>
</head>
<body class="composite">

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>Welcome to OA4MP client. OA4MP stands for <b>O</b>pen <b>A</b>uthorization for <b>M</b>any <b>P</b>eople,
    and allows open authorization with multiple identities.
    This describes the client software for the OA4MP service. It allows clients
    to request certificates and users to securely authorize them using the OAuth delegation protocol.</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Tomcat 9 or above (is using the servlet). SSL should be configured and enabled.</li>
    <li>Java <b>1.11</b> or above. </li>
</ul>

<h2>How many clients are there?</h2>
<p>
    OA4MP has a very simple servlet (packaged as a war) that can be used,
    though it is excruciatingly plain on purpose. It is intended that you boiler-plate out
    the good bits to your snazzy app. OA4MP also includes a command line client (CLC) which allows you to do all operations
    for a client from the command line. This is a surprisingly useful tool.
</p>
<h2>Getting and deploying.</h2>
<h3>Using the client installer</h3>
<p>To get the latest release, go to the <a href="https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/releases/latest">release page for OA4MP</a>
and choose the appropriate one (usually the latest). You will see a client-installer.jar. Download that and run it
like any other jar:</p>
<pre>
    &gt;java -jar client-installer.jar
</pre>
<p>
    This will print a lot of help and instructions. The two major case to invoke it are to install
    or to update. Update implies you have an existing, functional client installation and just
    want critical files updated. The install option will create a basic configuration and give
    instructions on what to do next. This includes the command line client, documentation, examples
    and a bunch of other very useful things. Do read the blurb printed at the end! Some utilities cannot
    be reasonable launched from inside Java, so depending on what you want to do, you may have to run,
    e.g. the key generation tool.
</p>
<h3>Just the war</h3>
<p>If you really only want the war, then you may just download the current reference war from
the release page.</p>


For many cases, this is all you need to do.

<p>Save this and deploy it to Tomcat. You may do this in several ways such as dropping the war into the
    $CATALINA_HOME/webapps directory. The system will not work until you have configured it then registered with an
    OA4MP server though.</p>
