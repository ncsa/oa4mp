    <title>Configuring QDL on the server</title>
</head>

<body class="composite">
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>To use QDL on the server, you must configure it. Fortunately, the configuration is
    pretty much a <a href="https://qdl-lang.org/pdf/qdl_configuration.pdf">standard QDL</a> configurations,
merely embedded in the service configuration.</p>
<h2>Additional features</h2>
<p>You may specify the <b>skipBadModulesOnLoad</b> flag in the QDL element. This tells OA4MP
that when deserializing workspaces, bad modules should be skipped (bad being defined as for some
strange reason unloadable, such as a missing Java module). This <i>may</i> cause errors later
if the module is used, but may also be fine in many cases.</p>
<p>You may also set server-wide scripts to run. These are detailed in <a href="scripting-hooks.html">scripting hooks</a></p>
