<h2>Using the Device Flow Servlet</h2>

<p>
    If you wish to enable the device flow (RFC 8628) then you should configure
    the servlet. You may either set a flag in the server tag to enable it,
    which means to simply accept all defaults, or you may (and probably should)
    properly configure it. All of these attributes live in the deviceFlowServlet
    element of the configuration.

            for the number of seconds that a request to this service is valid. This will be
            the lifetime of the authorization grant for this request. Note that if this is
            not set, the server-wide default for authorization grants is used. It may also
            be set on a per client basis, which supercedes all other values.

            characters for the code are ABC123DEF456, then (with the default separator)
            <pre>
                code period = 3 ==> ABC-123-DEF-456
                code period = 4 ==> ABC1-23DE-F456
                code period = 5 ==> ABC12-3DEF4-56
            </pre>
            The aim of the code period length is to allow the user to visually group
            characters together, rather than simply trying to grok a long string.

<h3>An Example</h3>
This has all of the defaults in a configuration
<pre>
    &lt;deviceFlowServlet
        authorizationURI="https://dev.cilogon.org/device_authorization"
        verificationURI="https://dev.cilogon.org/device"
        interval="5 sec."
        lifetime="1200 sec."
        codeChars="234679CDFGHJKLMNPQRTVWXZ"
        codeLength="9"
        codeSeparator="-"
        codePeriodLength="3"
    /&gt;
</pre>
Note that if this is omitted, then there is no device flow enabled. If you want
to use just the defaults for everything, you can use the rfc8628Enabled attribute
(set to true) in the server tag instead. You should have one or the other, not both.
