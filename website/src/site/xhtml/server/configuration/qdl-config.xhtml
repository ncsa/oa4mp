<h1>Configuring QDL.</h1>
<p>A great place to start is in the base system's configuration
    <a href="https://cilogon.github.io/qdl/docs/qdl_configuration.pdf">documentation</a>.
All of that is supported as well as extensions specific to OA4MP, which are documented here.</p>

<h2>Server mode and restricted IO</h2>
<p>In the standard QDL configuration there are two parameters that bear special mention here.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>server_mode</b>: limits various operations to the underlying OS, such as file reads and writes.</li>
    <li><b>restricted_io</b>: Allows printing (when false) and logging. </li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2>Naming</h2>
<p>If there is a single configuration, that may be named anything you like and it
will be used. If there are multiple configurations, then you should set the
attribute for <b>qdlConfigName</b> to be whatever the active configuration is.
If it is omitted, the default name of <b>qdl-default</b> will be used.</p>
<h2>Server scripts</h2>
<p>You may also have scripts specified in the QDL configuration. These are
JSON objects. (Is it ugly to have JSON inside XML? Sure. But it's consistent
with client configurations. <i>shrug.</i>) </p>
<h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>There are many reasons to have them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>Asserting claims for all clients.</b> There is no </li>
    <li><b>Administrative tasks</b> such as regularizing all the returned claims.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lifecycle</h3>
<p>If you give a script a specific exec_phase, the server scripts are run before any
other scripts. This may take a bit of planning. If you want to so something in the
post_auth phase after all clients have run their handlers, then you should
actually set the script for the pre_token phase to run before any other processing
in the next round.</p>
<h3>Clients may opt out</h3>
<p>Clients may skip server scripts if their <b>skipServerScripts</b> flag is
set.</p>
