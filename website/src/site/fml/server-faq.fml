        <faq id="admin clients">
            <question>What is an admin client?</question>
            <answer>OA4MP has a concept of administrative clients. These are clients that may
                create, approve, etc., standard OAuth clients. Why have these? Institutions frequently
                need to manage groups of clients. Say, a large national laboratory uses clients to
                manage access to resources for many research projects. The point is that the
                administrative client has the trust relationship that allows it to manage these.

        <faq id="creating an admin client">
            <question>How to I create and admin client?</question>
            <answer>There is a separate administrative client registration page (typically at
                host://oauth2/admin-register). Alternately, you can create one at the command
                line in teh CLI.

            <question>What is the CLI?</question>
            <answer>The OA4MP CLI (Command Lien Interface) is a character-mode application
                that allows wide-ranging administrative abilities to an OA4MP server. These include low
                level actions such as adding, aditing or removing clients, creating virtual organizations
                manually runnign garbage collection. Note that there is a complete reference available
                from within the CLI, so if you are running it, you should certainly be able to
                get help.

        <faq id="VOs">
            <question>What is a VO?</question>
            <answer>VO (short for Virtual Organization) creates a set of keys and
                a specified issuer for an organization. This is useful inside a larger
                organization, E.g. your university has clients but your department needs
                a specific issuer for various projects.
                These are relatively easy to create and work mostly seamlessly.
