To test long-term token lifetimes,

cd  /home/ncsa/dev/ncsa-git/oa4mp/server-test/src/main/resources/flow-tests/long-term
./start.qdl /home/ncsa/dev/ncsa-git/oa4mp/server-test/src/main/resources/flow-tests/test/lt-ids.ini

Then

./resume.qdl /home/ncsa/dev/ncsa-git/oa4mp/server-test/src/main/resources/flow-tests/test/lt-ids.ini  2> out.txt

Pipe std err to out.txt or someplace else because in the current release (5.4 for OA4MP) the HTTP Client
is antiquated (see https://github.com/ncsa/security-lib/issues/25) since there are a ton of Cookie errors
because the Cookie spec changed someething with the expiration dates.
