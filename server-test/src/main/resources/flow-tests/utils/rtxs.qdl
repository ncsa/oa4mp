   Given a client, this will run a series of exchanges and refreshes and return a set
   of all the access and refresh tokens.

   Arguments
   0 = the client which has been initialized and gotten the at least the first of tokens
   1 = integer for the number of times this is to run. Should be at least 2

   This returns args().1 sets of tokens. Each entry is of the form
   [X, tokens.]

   Where X is a string:
   txa = access token only tokens are from the exchange endpoint,
   txr = refresh token only tokens are from the exchange endpoint,
     r = both access and refresh tokens from the refresh endpoint.
