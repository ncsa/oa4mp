How to deploy the website.

*************************************
*   This only builds under maven 2  *
*************************************

* check in any changes to svn


* You *MUST* run

  mvn clean install

  from the ncsa-security-all and myproxy directories first. This is because the javadoc is created
  that way and installed in your local repository. The website merely references the generated javadoc.
  If there is no javadoc found you will get errors trying to build this website.

* Make sure you are running maven 2.2+ from this point on/ but not maven 3. Maven changed "doxia" (its
  internal markup for sites) See the Jira task OAUTH-111 for all the particulars. This will probably require
  hacking your PATH (at least on unix) so that the maven 2 bin directory is found before the maven 3 one.
  On my system this is the /usr/share/maven2/bin directory.
  Check the version by issuing

  mvn -version

* from the oa4mp-website directory issue

   mvn clean site

* tar up the resulting directory in target/site

* transfer it (e.g. with scp) to the target server (currently this is pkilab2.ncsa.uiuc.edu)

* Make sure you issue kinit and aklog on pkilab2 before trying to do anything or you will get all
  sorts of permissions errors on afs.

* Untar it into the  target directory (currently /afs/ncsa.uiuc.edu/web/grid.ncsa.uiuc.edu/htdocs/myproxy/oauth)

* Be sure that the directory is correct when you unpack it. It is easy to untar this in the wrong place.

Note that the javadoc as well as various maven-generated documents (reports on dependencies, etc.) are
created each time, so the deployed website is always up to date. Since updates to the live
website are not in SVN any such changes will be lost in the next deployment. Therefore

-> put all edits/updates under svn control and redeploy. Never update the live site if possible. <-
