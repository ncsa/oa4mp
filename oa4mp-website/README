*******************
Building it
*******************

The way this works is

1. Run the main massive build script ~/dev/scripts/.git-release-all. This *should* create javadoc for everything. If
   not then you will have to make sure the target is something like
   clean install javadoc:javadoc

2. Go to this directory and issue
   mvn clean site

3. You must copy everything in target/site to the cilogon.github.io project under the folder oa4mp.

4. Commit the cilogon.github.io project. The site should reflect this with "a few minutes".
