<h1>Registering a client with an OAuth 2 server</h1>

<p>Before you can delegate certificates using the OAuth for MyProxy service,
    you must register your OAuth for MyProxy client. In the course of this you will receive
    two things:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>a client identifier</li>
    <li>a client secret</li>
</ul>

<p>The <b>client identifier</b> is a unique string that is used to identify your client to the
server. This should be put into your configuration file. Rather than exchange public keys or
some other method of ensuring that your client is indeed authentic, a <b>client secret</b>
is generated at run time. This is the only time it actually is shown. The server merely
stores a hash of this rather than the actual value, consequently you have the only copy.
    If you lose this, you must register your client again.</p>

<h2>Filling out the registration form</h2>

<p>The default registration form looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="client/images/oauth2-client-registration-1.png"
        alt="Registration Form Image" width="893" height="624"/></p>

<p>The various fields are as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Client Name</strong>: A human readable name for the science gateway (OAuth for MyProxy client) that
        you are registering. This will be displayed to users and should identify your site.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Contact email</strong>: An email address where a human being can be reached for support.</li>
    <li><strong>Home url</strong>: The main address for your site. This will be displayed to users as part of the
        authentication process. It is not required to be secure.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Refresh token lifetime</strong>: (in seconds). This may be present but only if the server actually supports this
        feature. If it is available and you leave this blank, then no refresh tokens will be issued for your client.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Limited proxy support</strong>. This is mostly needed by servers that are affiliated with Globus. If this is present,
    you should understand what it does before checking it.</li>
    <li><strong>Callback URLs</strong>
          A list of callback URLs, one per line must be registered
          with the server. Client requests must send one of these and if the callback urls sent
          does not match one of the registered ones, the
          client request will be rejected. At this point, no wildcards are accepted.
        As per thje specification, all of these must be secure.
      </li>
</ul>

<p>Fill in the appropriate values. Note that the contact email should be for an actual person, not a generic
one for an organization since an email will be sent to it once the client has been approved. When you click
submit you should get a page like this</p>

<p><img src="client/images/oauth2-client-registration-2.png"
        alt="Succesful Regsitration Image" width="893" height="624"/></p>

<p>The only warning with the secret is to be sure that when you copy and paste it into the configuration file
that you do not introduce spaces or line breaks. The secret should be a single line. The server administrator
will get a notice that your client has requested approval and once this has been reviewed, an email will be sent
to the contact email you gave above.</p>
