<h2>Using the Authorization Servlet</h2>

<p>OA4MP has an authorization module that is built in. This may be replaced by installations as
    needed. Part of the specification is that, if this is disabled, the username and information
    about the client making the delegation request <b>must</b> be shown. This is called
    <b>client verification</b> and is required by the OAuth protocol. You may have OA4MP
    do this or disable this as well, though it is encumbant on the installation to show this information.
    This results in 3 use cases which are discussed below in depth, after the table of attributes.
</p>

        <td>false</td>
        <td>Valid values are "true" or "false". This flag forces the server to use the specified header.
            Note especially that if this is true and no such header is received then an exception is raised.

        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>Valid values are "true" or "false". This flag forces the server to return the DN (distinguished name)
            on the certificate as the username, as opposed to the usual name of the user. This has nothing to do
            with enabling the use of the header field.

        <td>N</td>
        <td>N/A</td>
        <td>Standard DN's (Distinguished names) are comma separated. Some versions of Globus, however, require
            that these be slash delimited. Enabling this option will convert commas to slashes using Globus's
            own utility for doing this. This means that you must
            <a href="server/manuals/getting-started.xhml">follow the installation instruction for JGlobus</a> to your Tomcat. Generally
            this option should rarely, if ever, be needed, so don't just enable it unless you are sure
            you know what it does and need it.

<h3>An Example</h3>
<pre>
&lt;config&gt;
   &lt;server name="my-config"&gt;
      &lt;authorizationServlet useHeader="true" headerFieldName="REMOTE_USER"&gt;
      &lt;!-- rest of config --&gt;
   &lt;\server&gt;
&lt;\config&gt;
</pre>
In this case, use of authorization headers is enabled and a header named <code>REMOTE_USER</code>
will be used. If it is missing though, no exception will be raised. By default, the header field will
be shown to the user along with client information and the user will be prompted if s/he wishes to continue.

<h3>Use cases</h3>
There are three main use cases which should be discussed in more depth. The particulars of how to configure
and authorization module are best dealt with elsewhere and a discussion can be found
<a href="../manuals/remote-user.xhtml">here</a>.
<h4>Using the OA4MP authorization module</h4>

<p>This is the default. In this case a logon will be shown to the user who will be prompted for the
    username and password. Since this page also contains the client information, the verification
    portion of the protocol is deemed satisfied. We highly recommend customizing the basic OA4MP page
    for a consistent look and feel in your site.</p>

<h4>Using another authorization module, but using OA4MP's verification page.</h4>

<p>In this case, the username and (possibly) password will be delivered in the header. We generally suggest that
    standard practice of using the <code>REMOTE_USER</code> header be used. Unless explicitly disabled,
    the verification page with the displayed username will be shown.</p>

<p>Options that may be configured here to</p>
<ul>
    <li>use the header</li>
    <li>required the header</li>
    <li>specify the header name</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifying that the header should be used implies that the header <i>may</i> be present. Since the
    username may be created also via an extension to the system (see below for details) the lack oof
    a header field is not an error. However, requiring the header will cause an exception if the header is not found.
    The default is to assume that the header is the <code>REMOTE_HEADER</code> field, though any field name
    may be specified.</p>

<h4>Completely replacing the authorization module.</h4>

<p>In this case the server must have some way of performing the client verification. You will need to write a webapp
    that completely takes over the functions at the <code>authorize</code> endpoint.
    (found in the <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/apidocs/index.html">javadoc</a>)
    should then be deployed elsewhere and invoked by your webapp when it has the username and password (if needed).
    Note that it is up to you to keep access to this servlet safe. We normally suggest that access be restricted to
    localhost only, so that only your webapp has access to the <code>AuthorizationServlet</code>.
    The <code>AuthorizationServlet</code> accepts the following call directly:</p>
<table border="2">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
        <td>Parameter key</td>
        <td>Parameter values</td>
        <td>Comment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>oauth_token</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>This is the token sent to the authorize endpoint as per the specification and identifies this
            user's delegation request uniquely.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AuthUserName</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>The username that will be sent unchanged to MyProxy</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>AuthPassword</td>
        <td>String</td>
        <td>(Optional) the password the user will require to log in to MyProxy.</td>
    </tr>

    <tr>
        <td>lifetime</td>
        <td>int</td>
        <td>(Optional) The lifetime for the certificate. The client may request any value in the initial request,
            but server policies may override this here. If missing, the request sent by the client
            will be used and if there is none, any defaults will be used.
        </td>
    </tr>

    </tbody>
</table>
<h3>Customizing the username sent to MyProxy programatically . The UsernameTransformer</h3>

<p>In this case, which e.g. occurs when using <a href="https://shibboleth.net/">Shibboleth</a>,
    you may create a completely customized handler that will allow you to create virtually any customized
    username for MyProxy you want from the request. You may also use it to set the username returned in
    the <code>getCert</code> response. This consists of a interface called UsernameTransformer which has
    two methods:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>createMyProxyUsername(HttpServletRequest) -- returns the username for MyProxy</li>
    <li>createReturnedUsername(HttpServletRequest, String) -- returns the username in the getCert response.</li>
</ul>
Generally you would implement this as a class and in the ServiceConfigLoader over ride the
<code>getUsernameTransformer</code>
<p>
to return an instance of your transformer. This will be automatically invoked at the approprate time. If either of these
methods return a null value, then they are simply ignored.</p>
