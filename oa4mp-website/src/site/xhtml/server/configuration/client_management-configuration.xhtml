<h2>Using the Dynamic Client Registration and management Servlet</h2>

<p>
    There are two parts to the client management. They are RFC 7951, which
    relates to creating a new client dynamically and RFC 7592 which
    extends that to allow for managing clients with get, update or deletion.
</p>
<p>
    There is also a native facility for oa4mp that can be used. This is kept
    mostly for legacy purposes and can be ignored. This came in to existence
    well before the RFC's were written and rather very similar. Generally
    unless you have clients that are using it, ignore it.
</p>
<p>
    All of the api elements below live in the clientManagement element of the
    server configuration. Note that if you omit that element, the defaults
    are used and the endpoint is active.

        requests will create an copy of this client and use any arguments as overrides. This allows
        you to have a uniform registration for all clients (e.g. all of your clients use the device flow
        and need identical configurations). This only applies to the rfc 7951 api. You would need
        to create this client (tip: never approve it) in the CLI before setting this.</td>

<h3>An Example</h3>

<pre>
    &lt;clientManagement&gt;
        &lt;api protocol="rfc7951"
         enabled="true"
         url="https://clients.foo.bar"
         anonymousOK="true"
         template="template:/client/generic" /&gt;
        &lt;api protocol="rfc7952" enabled="true" endpoint="oidc-cm" /&gt;
        &lt;api protocol="oa4mp" enabled="false"  /&gt;
    &lt;/clientManagement&gt;
</pre>
 <p>
     Note that omitting a protocol means that the component will be enabled with the defaults. Therefore
     you must explicitly disable things you do not want.
 </p>
<h3>Disabling all client management</h3>
<p>
    If you don't want any sort of dynamic client registration, simply disable everything as follows:
</p>
<pre>
    &lt;clientManagement enabled="false"&gt;
</pre>
