<h2><a name="Scopes"></a>Scopes</h2>


<p> OA4MP supports the scope parameter for servers. Unfortunately, <i>scope</i>
    has been completely overused and has acquired several meanings. To be completely clear,
    <b>scopes</b> are requests that ask for certain claims to be asserted in various tokens.</p>

<ul>
    
<li>requests for user meta data (e.g. <b>email</b>, <b>profile</b>, etc. These are
        returned in the ID token</li>
    
<li>requests for permissions to access resources, e.g. <b>storage.read:/public/physics/muon</b>
    and are returned in the access token.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember that, unhelpfully, if you send in a scope request, the resulting claim is asserted
using the scope tag again. This completely confuses many people since the request and response look
the same. It's the specification though, so we get to live with it. A fuller discussion about scopes
generally to be found <a href="../../pdf/scopes.pdf">here</a>. This blurb is concerned with configuring
a server or client to use scopes.</p>


<p>
    The id token is a JWT (JSON Web Token) which has a header (signing information),
    payload (a base 64 encoded JSON object), and signature, plus a system
    for verifying the signature. Historically, since this could be trusted by
    checking with the server if it had been altered, people started using it as a type of access
    token. That's both a good and bad idea, since it is not really designed for granting access
    to things, but, yes, it can be verified.
    At this point, all the tokens an OAuth 2 server could create (authorization, access, refresh)
    started to mutate into JWTs. This is a good thing. OA4MP lets you do this, it also will
    issue old style opaque tokens.
</p>

<p>
    <i>A note about native tokens in OA4MP.</i> These are unforgeable, self-describing and unique
    (unlike many OAuth servers where they are indeed just random strings). Here is an example of one:</p>

<div>
<pre>
    https://cilogon.org/oauth2/6c41b109f62d6776976bc23816e97f5a?type=refreshToken&amp;ts=1683061597117&amp;version=v2.0&amp;lifetime=500000000
</pre></div>
    
<p>If you do not want/need JWTs for your service, you will get these. If you do get JWTs, these native
    tokens will be used as the <b>jti</b> unique identifier.
</p>

<p>
    This sure is messy you think. Is there another way to request scopes? Sort of. Another attempts was to
    create essentially an entire request language per
    claim in the <b>claim</b> parameter, but that turned into such a mess and most servers don't support that.
    OA4MP most certainly does not mostly since the requests are even hard to write.
    I am relating this history because people who are new to this often have a devil of a time figuring
    out why the scope parameter does what it does.
</p>

</section><section>
<h2><a name="The_basic_supported_scopes_in_OA4MP_are"></a>The basic supported scopes in OA4MP are </h2>

<ul>
    
<li>openid - (optional) treat the request as OIDC, meaning an id token is created and at the least will
                 contain the <i>sub</i> claim for the user.</li>
    
<li>email - returns the user's email address, if available.</li>
    
<li>profile - returns information about the user's profile</li>
    
<li>org.oa4mp:userinfo - similar to org.cilgon.userinfo. The difference is that if the client is set to
    use restricted scopes, only a restricted subset of scopes is returned. If the client is not so
    restricted, this is equivalent to org.cilogon.userinfo.</li>
    
<li>org.cilogon.userinfo - returns all enabled information about the user from the service and allows
    access to the user information endpoint. </li>
    
<li>edu.uiuc.ncsa.myproxy.getcert - <span style="background-color: #ff6600;">(deprecated!)</span>
        the server returns a certificate from the getCert endpoint.
        If the client omits this, then attempts to get
        a certificate will be rejected. However, requests to the user info endpoint will still be processed.
    </li>
    
<li>offline_access - (optional) some clients send this when requesting a refresh token. If
    it is included, the <b>prompt</b> parameter must be set to <i>consent</i> (this is just the spec.)
    Note that OA4MP clients are simply configured to issue refresh tokens or not,
    so this parameter is ignored. It cannot, for instance, be used to force the server to issue refresh tokens.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><i>Nota Bene:</i></b> Clients on the server (as opposed to free standing clients)
    by default are configured with the <b>strict_scopes</b> set to true.
    What that means is that any scope not in its configured scope list will raise an error.
    This is done since clients that typically need a handful of specific scopes should be alerted if
    an unknown scope is requested. The spec says that  unknown scopes may be ignored and that is
    common enough for most OAuth 2 servers, but our experience is that the vast majority of times
    there is a typo in the scope (so requesting emaile not email) and it is far better that the request fail
    initially so it can be fixed rather than have a mystery that the email claim is not asserted.
</p>

<p>If you need a lot of flexibility in setting claims (such as for SciTokens or WLCG token requests
that are asserted in the access token), set the <b>strict_scopes</b> to false. You can pass in anything
at that point and the more standard OAuth 2 behvaior of just ignoring anything unknown will be in effect.</p>

<h2><a name="Setting_a_handler_.28server_configuration_only.21.29"></a>Setting a <a href="#handler">handler</a> (server configuration only!)</h2>

<p>There is a handler attribute in the scopes tag. This allows you to specify a
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://oa4mp.org/apidocs/edu/uiuc/ncsa/oa4mp/delegation/oa2/server/claims/ClaimSource.html">claim source</a>
    implementation that will be invoked
    automatically for every phase, adding the resulting claims to the set a class that has a no-argument. While there are claim
    sources that are included in the standard OA4MP distribution, (such as for an LDAP claim source),
    the aim is that you can write your own and have it run. Generally this <i>should not</i> be used, except as
    a very specific custom extension to OA4MP. In particular, this contract has no way to pass along any
    configuration to the handler.
 </p>

<p>If you want a claim source to be run automatically, the easiest way is in a QDL script to add it (with the
<b>~ operator</b>) to the claim_sources. So a typical use in the pre or post_auth phase in your QDL script would be:</p>

<div>
<pre>
              cfg. := claims#new_template('file');
   cfg.'claim_key' := 'eppn'; // configures it as per <a class="externalLink" href="https://oa4mp.org/pdf/creating_claim_sources2.pdf">here</a>
    claim_sources. := claim_sources. ~ [claims#create_source(cfg.)]; // automate getting claims by the system
</pre></div>

<p>This creates a file claim source and adds it to the list of claim sources the server runs. You need to add
this once and it will be managed ever thereafter. The downsides to this approach are that you no longer have
control over it and it may be invoked a great deal more that you would want or need. Generally, adding
to the list of claim sources is discouraged. It is simply better the get the claims you want and add them
where you want them, e.g. from the NCSA client script:</p>

<div>
<pre>
    cfg. := claims#new_template('ncsa');
    cfg. := claims#create_source(cfg.);
 claims. := claims. ~ claims#get_claims(cfg., claims.'uid');
</pre></div>

<p>Which creates a claim source, gets the claim claims and adds them to the existing claims.</p>

<h2><a name="Setting_scopes_in_the_configuration"></a>Setting scopes in the configuration</h2>

<p>The configuration allows you to set statically
    which scopes are requested as follows. This is in both the client configuration, where it is used to
    construct the request with the given scopes, and the server configuration, where it sets a fixed
    list of scopes that will be strictly honored (by default). The top-level tag is the scopes
    tag and that in turn contains scope tags. These scope tags contain a single scope and
    supports a single attribute:
</p>


<table class="bodyTable" style="text-align: left; width: 100%;" border="1" cellspacing="2" cellpadding="2">
    <tbody>
    
<tr class="a">
         
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Name</td>
         
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Required</td>
         
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Default</td>
         
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Description</td>
     </tr>
    
<tr class="b">
        
<td style="vertical-align: top;">enabled</td>
        
<td style="vertical-align: top;">N</td>
        
<td style="vertical-align: top;">true</td>
        
<td style="vertical-align: top;">Enable or disable this scope.</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

</section><section>
<h2><a name="A_client_example"></a>A client example</h2>

<div>
<pre>
&lt;config&gt;
   &lt;client name=&quot;my-cfg&quot;&gt;
    &lt;scopes&gt;
        &lt;scope&gt;custom.scope&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/scopes&gt;
        &lt;!-- other stuff.. --&gt;
    &lt;client&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The client will include <b>custom.scope</b> in requests to the server <i>in addition to the standard scopes</i>.
   The default OA4MP client behavior is to request all the standard scopes (exception offline_access). Additions
   to the scopes element are therefore additive. To disallow a scope, disable it:</p>

<div>
<pre>
    &lt;config&gt;
       &lt;client name=&quot;my-cfg&quot;&gt;
        &lt;scopes&gt;
            &lt;scope enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt;edu.uiuc.ncsa.myproxy.getcert&lt;/scope&gt;
        &lt;/scopes&gt;
            &lt;!-- other stuff.. --&gt;
        &lt;client&gt;
    &lt;/config&gt;

</pre></div>

<p>This would omit the getcert scope, but request all the other scopes.</p>

</section><section>
<h2><a name="A_server_example"></a>A server example</h2>

<div>
<pre>
&lt;config&gt;
   &lt;service name=&quot;my-server&quot;&gt;
    &lt;scopes&gt;
    &lt;scope enabled=&quot;false&quot;&gt;edu.uiuc.ncsa.myproxy.getcert&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;scope&gt;my.custom.scope&lt;/scope&gt;
    &lt;/scopes&gt;
        &lt;!-- other stuff.. --&gt;
    &lt;/service&gt;
&lt;/config&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>In this case, in the registration page, the custom scope of <b>my.custom.scope</b> would be presented
as an option, but the getcert scope would not. These scopes would then be added to the client's configuration
so that requests with <b>my.custom.scope</b> would be accepted. Of course, some form of processing to
do somethign with that scope is needed, e.g. QDL scripting.</p>


<section>
<h3><a name="Final_caveat_for_OA4MP_clients"></a>Final caveat for OA4MP clients</h3>


<p>The standard OA4MP client sends along only the scope parameter in the initial request. You may also
    send along scopes in the token, refresh and exchange phases but you need to customize to do that.
