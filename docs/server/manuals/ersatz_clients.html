<h1>Ersatz Clients</h1>
<section>
<h2><a name="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>

<p>The ability for a client to take over the flow that another has initiated is
referred to as <i>substitution</i> and clients that are specifically tasked with
this as referred to as <i>ersatz clients</i>. We use the cognated word
&#x1d570;&#x1d597;s&#x1d586;&#x1d599;&#x1d59f; (which just means substitute in German) because words like delegate,
impersonate, substitute etc. are so overloaded in English that discourse
is getting hard -- more time is spent on what the word means in context than anything
else. An ersatz client has a very specific, narrow definition
and there should be few if any conflicts with other nomenclature.</p>
<section>
<h3><a name="Definition_of_an_ersatz_client"></a>Definition of an ersatz client</h3>

<p>An <i>ersatz client</i> in OA4MP is a specific type of
client which may substitute for another in a flow. A client that starts a flow is called
the <i>provisioning client.</i> A provisioning client is just a standard client
in OA4MP and may be confidential or public. If A is the provisioning client and &#x3b1; is an ersatz client
we say write A &#x227b; &#x3b1; and refer to &quot;A provisions &#x3b1;&quot; or that &quot;&#x3b1; can substitute for A&quot;. &#x227a; 	&#x227b;  </p>

<ul>
    
<li>All substitution relations are explicit and must be set.</li>
    
<li>Ersatz clients cannot start a flow and can only be used at the token exchange (RFC 8693) endpoint.</li>
    
<li>Ersatz clients are restricted in their scopes to whatever the provisioning client has and may only downscope.</li>
    
<li>If A &#x227b; &#x3b1;, then &#x3b1; inherits the configuration (lifetimes, scripts etc.) from A unless explicitly overridden.</li>
    
<li>These may be chained as A &#x227b; &#x3b1; &#x227b; &#x3b2; &#x227b; &#x3b3; ... which connotes an inheritance chain for abilities, not necessarily a custodial chain.</li>
    
<li>&#x227b; is not an ordering relationship! It is perfectly acceptable to have a multiple provisioning
    clients, A, B, C and set A &#x227b; &#x3b1;, B &#x227b; &#x3b1;, C &#x227b; &#x3b1;.  This is because these relations are set by security policies which
    may be quite arbitrary.</li>
    
<li>it is perfectly acceptable to have multiple ersatz clients, so A &#x227b; &#x3b1;, A &#x227b; &#x3b2;, A &#x227b; &#x3b3;.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Relationship_to"></a>Relationship to </h2>

<p><a class="externalLink" href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8693">The token exchange specification</a> has
a section on impersonation and delegation semantics. It states <i>in toto</i> </p>


<blockquote> When principal A impersonates principal B, A is given all the rights
   that B has within some defined rights context and is
   indistinguishable from B in that context.  Thus, when principal A
   impersonates principal B, then insofar as any entity receiving such a
   token is concerned, they are actually dealing with B.  It is true
   that some members of the identity system might have awareness that
   impersonation is going on, but it is not a requirement.  For all
   intents and purposes, when A is impersonating B, A is B within the
   context of the rights authorized by the token.  A's ability to
   impersonate B could be limited in scope or time, or even with a one-
   time-use restriction, whether via the contents of the token or an
   out-of-band mechanism.</blockquote>


<p>What this means is that our substitutions are a form of impersonation and that
the trust relations are made out of band. Why not call this impersonation? Because
other OAuth systems are free to implement this any way they want and we want to be clear
exactly how we do it. </p>
</section><section>
<h2><a name="Where_do_they_live.3F"></a>Where do they live?</h2>

<p>Ersatz clients are administered by an admin client just like any other and may be
created like any other. Since they may inherit from the provisioning client, there is really
not much of a need to do more than create it with credentials and flag it as an ersatz client.</p>
</section><section>
<h2><a name="Using_them"></a>Using them</h2>

<p>Normally if A &#x227b; &#x3b1;, then A starts the flow and in the token exchange, &#x3b1; presents the
access or refresh token to the exchange endpoint. If &#x3b1; is presented for the first time,
the flow forks. Note that A cannot resume the flow for &#x3b1; after this point and they become
independent, meaning that if A provisions &#x3b1; with an access token, &#x3c4;, then &#x3b1; exchanges it for &#x3c4;',
A cannot use &#x3c4;'. On the other hand, if A &#x227b; &#x3b2; as well then A may provision &#x3b2; with &#x3c4; too.</p>

<p>While there may be chains of substitution, such as A &#x227b; &#x3b1; &#x227b; &#x3b2; &#x227b; &#x3b3;, you must present the final
ersatz client, &#x3b3; here. In other words, the endpoints of chains determine how the substitution is made</p>
<section>
<h3><a name="Why_would_you_want_intermediate_ersatz_clients.3F"></a>Why would you want intermediate ersatz clients?</h3>

<p>If you have a very large and complex set of substitutions, you may stream line the flow. Let
us say that you have provisioning clients A, B, C, D and (say these provision with some logic
centered on IDPs or perhaps the hosting institution)
you need to have finer grained control. An ersatz client &#x3be; with a specific script
(say allowing Lab X) could be used as A &#x227b; &#x3be; &#x227b; &#x3b1; and B &#x227b; &#x3be; &#x227b; &#x3b2;, (say &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; are used by specific groups
within Lab X) so that &#x3b1; and &#x3b2; have consistent behavior but can add their own logic. </p>

<h2><a name="Inheritance_and_provisioning"></a>Inheritance and provisioning</h2>

<p>
    Clients in OA4MP may set <i>prototypes</i> which are other clients from which they
    inherit configuration. There may be multiple prototypes (effectively yielding
    multiple inheritance). Note well that the order you set determines resolution. So if
    you have 2 prototype clients A and B (in that order) that means that the values of B
    override the values in A. The values of the base client override all others. This means that
    you can have a client that is little more than an id and secret which inherits everything
    else from its prototype, or just sets a single attribute even.
</p>

<p>
    Since provisioning clients can form a prototype hierarchy, there is an attribute for clients
    named<b>extendsProvisioners</b> and this means that the provisioners should be used as the
    prototype hierarchy. This is a very common pattern. If you set this and specify prototypes,
    then provisioning clients are used first, followed by all specifically set prototypes.
