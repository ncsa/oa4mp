<h1>Dynamic Client Registration</h1>

<p>The <a class="externalLink" href="https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-registration-1_0.html">dynamic client registration</a>
    specification
    is supported in OA4MP as of version 4.2. This means that a trusted administrative client can dynamically
    create regular clients for use with an OA4MP system. If you have not done so already, you should
    read the section on
    <a href="administrative-clients.html">administrative clients </a>.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> When we refer to a client we mean an OAuth 2 client and otherwise any other will be qualified such
    as &quot;admin client&quot;.</p>

<section>
<h2><a name="How.27s_it_work.3F"></a>How's it work?</h2>

<p>
    If you are not an administrator and just need a client, you can go
    to the registration endpoint of the service or use an anonymous registration (see below).
    Your request will then be seen by the site adminstrator(s)
    and once approved, you will be notified. OA4MP allows
    for an administration client that is trusted (after vetting, of course) who
    must manage several OAuth clients to do so without having to resort to the usual vetting process.
</p>
<section>
<h3><a name="Looking_for_how_to_configure_the_server.3F"></a>Looking for how to configure the server?</h3>

<p>If you are running OA4MP, then this facility is configured on the server as per
    <a href="../configuration/client_management-configuration.html">client management configuration</a>.
</p>
</section><section>
<h3><a name="How_to_become_an_admin"></a>How to become an admin</h3>

<p>You must register an administrative client as per <a href="administrative-clients.html">here</a>.</p>

</section><section>
<h3><a name="Implemented_specifications_here."></a>Implemented specifications here.</h3>


<p>The two specifications that are behind this are <a class="externalLink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7591">RFC 7591</a>
    and <a class="externalLink" href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7592">RFC 7592</a>. The flow is that you register an
    administrative client. This is initially not approved and any operation you try will fail
    with a message to that effect. We get an notification and once the admin client is approved,
    it may be used. All calls then create regular (not admin!) clients for use with OA4MP.
</p>


<p>The RFCs specify a REST-ful API for clients, so that</p>


<ul>
    
<li><b>POST</b> creates a new client</li>
    
<li><b>GET</b> lists what the server knows about this client</li>
    
<li><b>PUT</b> will update the client</li>
    
<li><b>DELETE</b> will remove the client and all of its information from the server</li>
</ul>

</section><section>
<h3><a name="Getting_A_List_Of_Clients"></a>Getting A List Of Clients</h3>

<p>
    OA4MP does have one nice little extension for querying clients.
    If you do a GET with no client id, then a list of all client ids and names
    known to this admin will be returned.</p>

</section><section>
<h3><a name="Getting_server_defaults"></a>Getting server defaults</h3>

<p>You may also get defaults for the service by issuing a request with the query parameter set to
    org.oa4mp:/server#defaults.
    For instance on my local server</p>

<div>
<pre>
    curl -k --get --data-urlencode &quot;query=org.oa4mp:/server#defaults&quot;  https://localhost:9443/oauth2/oidc-cm
{
    &quot;at_issuer&quot;:&quot;https://localhost:9443/oauth2&quot;,
    &quot;at_lifetime&quot;:900,
    &quot;auth_grant_lifetime&quot;:750,
    &quot;id_token_lifetime&quot;:900,
    &quot;idt_max_lifetime&quot;:1800,
    &quot;issuer&quot;:&quot;https://localhost:9443/oauth2&quot;,
    &quot;max_at_lifetime&quot;:1800,
    &quot;max_id_token_lifetime&quot;:1800,
    &quot;max_rt_lifetime&quot;:2592000,
    &quot;rtGracePeriod&quot;:3600,
    &quot;rt_lifetime&quot;:1296000,
    &quot;rt_lifetime_create_default&quot;:-1,
    &quot;rt_lifetime_update_default&quot;:0,
    &quot;use_server_default&quot;:-1
}
</pre></div>

<p>where all time values are in seconds. The following table summarizes these. Note that
    if you have an admin client and send the credentials, the values for the issuer will
    reflect the values in the virtual organization. Otherwise, they are for the server
    generally. All lifetimes are in seconds. It is true that <i>some</i> of these are on the
    well-known page, however many are not and since there is no canonical way to represent
    them there, a separate call was created.</p>

<h3><a name="Versions"></a>Versions</h3>

<p>
    Since OA4MP supports various attributes that are not standard, the response from the server
    for GET, PUT etc. can vary depending on the server version. The standard attributes are always
    faithefully reported in all versions, so the version simply refers to the OA4MP extensions
    reported. Note that if you query the server for its defaults, these are returned. Starting in OA4MP 5.5,
    this may be explicitly specified in one of two ways.
</p>

<ul>
    
<li>as an additional component in the URL path, so a path of <b>https://myserver.org/oauth2/register/v5.5</b>
        would set the API version to 5.5.
    </li>
    
<li>as a query parameter with key <b>api_version</b>. If present, this overrides the path component. E.g.
        <b>https://myserver.org/oauth2/register?api_version=v5.5...</b></li>
</ul>

<p>The major versions are </p>

<ul>
    
<li><b>v5.5</b> -- fully spec compliant and returns <i>all</i> values on the server, even those set as defaults. The
        aim is
        to expose more to clients so they can roundtrip more fully.
    </li>
    
<li><b>v5.4</b> -- limited values, in particular, rt_lifetime and at_lifetime are never allowed to be negative, but
        zero values for those are reported. (Negative -1 as a value means the client uses whatever the current server
        default is.)
    </li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="The_toolkit"></a>The toolkit</h3>

<p>Included with the latest release on <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp">GitHub</a>
    are a suite of associated command line scripts in oidc-cm-scripts.tar aka the <b><i>toolkit</i></b>
    which contains a complete but minimal functional toolkit. There are basic scripts for each
    method as well as several examples for using each.</p>


<p>To dynamically register a client you need to make a call to the supported service
    endpoint, typically ../oauth2/oidc-cm with the appropriate HTTP method
    and payload. The specification should not be repeated here but the toolkit has a tutorial
    and many examples. There is also a very detailed
    <a class="externalLink" href="https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/blob/master/oa4mp-server-admin-oauth2/src/main/scripts/oidc-cm-scripts/readme.txt">readme.txt</a>
    in the toolkit.</p>

<h3><a name="Parameters_specific_to_OA4MP"></a>Parameters specific to OA4MP</h3>

<p>OA4MP allows you to specify several client properties that it uses which are not in the specification.
    These are listed below in a table</p>

<p>Note that all of these are subject to server policies. You may request an outlandish refresh token
    lifetime, e.g., but if server policy restricts it, then the server will make the final determination.
</p>

</section></section><section>
<h2><a name="Anonymous_registration"></a>Anonymous registration</h2>

<p>An <b><i>anonymous registration</i></b> is simply creating a standard client without an associated admin client.
    In other words
    it is pretty much exactly like creating a basic client using the registration endpoint, although
    various OA4MP attributes are available that are not at the registration endpoint. This still
    restricts certain things you can configure, such as the cfg attribute.
    (Remember that an admin client has a vetted trust relationship with the server,
    so it has much wider latitude to create a standard client.)</p>

</section><section>
<h2><a name="Public_clients"></a>Public clients</h2>

<p>A <b><i>public client</i></b> is a standard client that is allowed only the user metadata openid scope
    (so not the org.cilogon.userinfo scope, e.g.). The primary function of a public client is to
    answer if the user has logged in to the system. If the client is anonymous, that is the only scope allowed.
    If the client is managed, it is possible the admin may allow other scopes for access tokens as well.</p>

            token endpoint.
