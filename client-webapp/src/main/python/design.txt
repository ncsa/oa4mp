Notes on what went into the design.

- Everything runs under virtualenv. This will be the easiest all the way around
    - if an install doesn't want this, they can always install the code directly
        into their environment. Should not require they install it there though.
- Need to use python oauth2 (which is actually oauth 1.0a)
- Need to include xml-based files and some minimal (at least) parsing.
    - decided to use built-in minidom to reduce install headaches
    - must support named configurations
- Need logging support
    - Some options (such as log size, aging) probably won't work
        Edit: there is log rotation via the RotatingFileHandler
- Need RSA-SHA1 signing. This will have to be farmed out to the openssl
    wrapper
    - There is a python wrapper for openssl, but this wraps only a few things
    - There is no support for RSA-SHA1 signatures in the oauth2 library.
        This must be written as an extension.
    - Generally will need a temporary secure directory for openSSL, so this
          will be in the python but not java configuration
