<body>
        <h1>Welcome the OAuth for Many People Service!</h1>

        This page simply contains information about the OA4MP (OAuth for Many People) delegation service.
        To access the functionality, you will need a client and a login.
        There is not much a user can do directly with this site. This page is aimed at client and server developers.
        <h2>What does it do?</h2>
        This service allows a user to request tokens of various sorts as well as
        X.509 certificates from <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/">MyProxy</a> for use by a client.
        When a client needs a certificate to do something on a user's behalf, it initiates a request to this site.
        The user authorizes this at this server ( not on the client which would be insecure).
        The certificate is then obtained and returned to the client.

        <h2>How does it do it?</h2>
        Magic. Well, not quite. You can read the
        <A href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749">OAuth 2 specification</a>
        for
        all the gory details (and there are a lot of them, I might add). Suffice to say it is nontrivial.

        <H3>Client sources</h3>
        If you are looking to set up a gateway, then you should read up
        <a href="http://grid.ncsa.illinois.edu/myproxy/oauth/client/index.xhtml">how to set up an OAuth for MyProxy client</a>
        on how to get the sources, build them (if needed) and incorporate them into your gateway. The details are put
        into a
        very simple service API
        so adding this functionality to your gateway should be quite straightforward -- that is the aim.
        <h3>Client registration</h3>

        To register your client with a server, be sure to look at
        <a href="http://www.oa4mp.org/client/manuals/registering-with-a-server.html">Registering
            A Client</a>
        which describes how to do this.
