    <!--
    This is a dummy web.xml file! We use maven overlays and each module that uses this one needs
    to supply its own web.xml. However, maven itself will not build this module unless there is a web.xml
    in the right place. Therefore, this has nothing in it.

    Note: CILogon has a dependency on this as the "minimal OA4MP webapp". No branding etc.
     so CILogon can change that as needed.

    OA4MP itself uses the webapp in oa4mp-server-oauth2.
