<H2>A sample client</H2>
<p>
    This package contains a fully functional but very basic client. The classes are for the most part
    provided with the aim that they will be harvested for code snippets. It will (when properly configured)
    carry out the complete delegation sequence with the given OA4MP server. It will display an intermediate step
    so the developer can see the redirect to the authorization site, then at the end of the sequence, it will
    display the user information from the returned cert. No storage of generated private keys or returned certificates
    is supplied in this demonstration.
