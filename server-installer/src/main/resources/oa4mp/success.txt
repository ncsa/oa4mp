Done! You should add
  export OA4MP_SERVER="${ROOT}"
to your environment and
   $OA4MP_SERVER/bin
to your PATH
Now, generate server key file: ${OA4MP_HOME}etc/keys.jwk

by running:

${OA4MP_HOME}bin/jwt -in ${OA4MP_HOME}etc/create_keys.cmd

When done, the keys and a default will be set in your configuration file.
If you want a different default key, select one of the printed key ids ('kid')
and set it in the defaultKeyID property of the

${ROOT}etc/cfg.xml file.

Tomcat setup.
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
During installation, the server war (web archive) is downloaded to

${OA4MP_HOME}lib/oauth2.war

If you want to use a self-signed cert, read the blurb at

https://oa4mp.org/common/manuals/using-self-signed-cert.html

Assuming that Tomcat is installed in $CATALINA_HOME, you should
(1) edit the $CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml file and add the following
    right after the <web-app> tag:

    <context-param>
        <param-name>oa4mp:oauth2.server.config.file</param-name>
        <param-value>${OA4MP_HOME}etc/cfg.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>

    <context-param>
        <param-name>oa4mp:oauth2.server.config.name</param-name>
        <param-value>default</param-value>
    </context-param>

(2) Copy the oauth2.war to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps
    This should be noticed by Tomcat and auto-deployed

(3) Copy ${OA4MP_HOME}/lib/wdll-known.war to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/.well-known.war
    This should be noticed and deployed by Tomcat

    NOTE the leading period in the target!! The correct name  of this war is
    .well-known.war which runs the .well-known service for Tomcat. Unfortunately,
    in many unix-based operating systems, a file that starts with a period is hidden,
    making it very hard to upload one or download it. Therefore, it is uploaded
    without a period. In a standard OA4MP install, this should just work and require
    little more than deploying it.

(3) Test that it is up and running at the oauth2 endpoint.  You should be able to go
    to either the registration page or the .well-known/openid-configuration page.

Consider installing QDL
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
QDL is used heavily internally in OA4MP. It is installable as qdl-installer.jar from

https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/releases/latest

This version has a bunch of specific extensions to OA4MP. After install, the QDL docs directory
has pretty much everything in PDF format for both QDL and OA4MP, which is also available
on the web.
