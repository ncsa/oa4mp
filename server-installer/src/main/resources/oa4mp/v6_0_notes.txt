Release notes for OA4MP Server version 6.0.2
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Welcome to OA4MP Server 6.0! This has several fixes, listed on the release
page on GitHub https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/releases/tag/v6.0.2.

Among other features is the addition of support for the client credentials flow
as well a complete (internal) package rename of classes so all packages now start
with org.oa4mp.

(This last bit is transparent if you are new to OA4MP but might possibly
cause an issue if you have, e.g. written a custom extension to it and need to tweak a few
package names.)

At the end of the install, you will have a minimal but serviceable configuration
that you may use. It is a starting point and should be reviewed.

If you are installing both client and server on the same machine, they do
use different directories, we suggest E.g.

/opt/oa4mp/client and /opt/oa4mp/server
