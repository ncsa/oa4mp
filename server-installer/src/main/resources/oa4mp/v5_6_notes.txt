Release notes for OA4MP Server version 5.6
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Welcome to OA4MP Server 5.6! This has several fixes, listed on the release
page on GitHub https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/releases/tag/v5.6.

At the end of the install, you will have a minimal but serviceable configuration
that you may use. It is a starting point and should be reviewed.

If you are installing both client and server on the same machine, they do
use different directories, we suggest E.g.

/opt/oa4mp/client and /opt/oa4mp/server
