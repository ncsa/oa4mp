Done! You should add
  export OA4MP_HOME="${ROOT}"
to your environment and
   $OA4MP_HOME/bin
to your PATH

Finishing the configuration file
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
The generated configuration file resides at

   ${OA4MP_HOME}/etc/cfg.xml

There is a default configuration, but it needs to have the following set

  Tag           | Description
 ---------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------
  <id>          | The client id, generated at registration
  <serviceUri>  | The OAuth 2 server's address
  <callbackUri> | The callback you will use
  <secret>      | The client secret (unless using keys, see below),
                | generated at registration
  <jwksFile>    | Path to your JSON web keys file, if using keys
  <kid>         | The JWK identifier you wish to use, if using keys


Tomcat install
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
If you need to set up a self-signed cert for Tomcat, read the blurb at

   https://oa4mp.org/common/manuals/using-self-signed-cert.html

first and follow the instructions there. You will need to set the
connector in Tomcat (if you are installing OA4MP server, you
can just do this once and for all for tomcat). Note especially you will have
to set the keystore in the client configuration. (There is a commented
out block that has most of that done, btw.)

The war (web archive) file is in the ${OA4MP_HOME}lib/client2.war.
Assuming Tomcat is installed at $CATALINIA_HOME,
 To deploy:
 (1) Add the following to your $CATALINA_HOME/conf/web.xml file
     right after the opening web-app tag:

    <context-param>
        <param-name>oa4mp:oauth2.client.config.file</param-name>
        <param-value>${OA4MP_HOME}etc/cfg.xml</param-value>
    </context-param>
    <context-param>
        <param-name>oa4mp:oauth2.client.config.name</param-name>
        <param-value>default</param-value>
    </context-param>

(2) Copy ${OA4MP_HOME}lib/client2.war to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps
    It should auto-deploy and be available at the client2 endpoint.

(3) Check the client2 endpoint under Tomcat is working.

Using Keys (RFC 7523)
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
If you want to use public and private keys for authorization, then **before registering**,
run:

${OA4MP_HOME}bin/jwt -batchFile ${OA4MP_HOME}etc/create_keys.cmd

The defaults for using keys are already in the generated cfg.xml file.
This command creates a full set

private keys : ${OA4MP_HOME}etc/keys.jwk
 public keys : ${OA4MP_HOME}etc/public-keys.jwk

If you opt to use keys, then at registration, just paste the contents of
public-keys.jwk in to the registration page.
