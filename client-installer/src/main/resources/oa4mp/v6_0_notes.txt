Release notes for OA4MP Client version 6.0
‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾‾
Welcome to OA4MP Client 6.0! This has several fixes, listed on the release
page on GitHub https://github.com/ncsa/oa4mp/releases/tag/v6.0.

This will install both the command line client (CLC) and download the current
war file for a Tomcat deploy. These are independent, but both read the same
configuration file for a client.

At the end of the installation, you will have a minimal but serviceable configuration
that you may use. It is a starting point and should be reviewed.

If you are installing both client and server on the same machine, they do
use different directories, we suggest E.g.

/opt/oa4mp/client and /opt/oa4mp/server
