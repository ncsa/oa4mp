    <!-- A configuration that runs on localhost and uses a derby store.
         * This can be used as a template for others.
         * It has the standard id and secret pair, which you set from
           registering this client with an OA4MP server.
         * Alternately, you can also set a JSON Web Key (JWK) for RFC 7523
           authorization. Also set the key id (kid).
         * Set the serviceUri to point to the OA4MP server.
         * Set the callbackUri to be the same as you gave during registration.
           You may have several, but this is the one active for a flow
         * The derby setup has some random password. Since the store is managed
           for you, these can be changed to anything before running the client.
         * The SSL block is commented out. If you are running an OA4MP instance with your
           own self-signed cert, you will need to point to that here.  The cert has a DN
           set and that should be set in the certDN entry.
