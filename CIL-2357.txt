These are notes for Patrick Carnussio's request. The request is to allow for sending a user right after authentication,
 but who needs some other onboarding process to a site, which can then forward them back to OA4MP and resume the
 flow. This will be invoked in a QDL script.

 Tasks
 -----
 * Allow for configuring AG (auth grant) lifetimes and max lifetimes, like AT, RT.
 * Have specific QDL flag for this. OA4MP should then create the necessary uri.
 * The uri has address for the service authroize endpoint, it includes as parameters the
   grant_type=oa4mp:grant-type:authentication:resume
   jwt=JHWT (see below)
 * The JWT payload consists of the AG, iat and exp claims.
 * If the client has a registered public key, sign the JWT with it so the receiver can verify its
   authenticity.
 * Allow configuration of client to do authN resumption, as well as allow for unsigned JWTs.
 * authN resumes with processing of the QDL script, which is where the flow was interuppted.
